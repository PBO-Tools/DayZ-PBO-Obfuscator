## About The Project



<h3 align="center">Overview:</h3> 
PBO Tools is available completely free of charge and provides powerful obfuscation capabilities for your PBOs, making it more difficult for workshop thieves to steal your server's source code.

For enhanced obfuscation features, we also offer paid versions of the software. You can find more information about these options on our website at https://pbo.tools.

To use the software, simply drag the application onto your desktop and ensure your mod is located in your P Drive. If your mod is not in your P Drive, you will receive an error message. Next, drag your mod onto PBO Tools to open the application and choose from a range of options:

1. Obfuscate PBO: This option enables or disables PBO obfuscation.
2. Compress PBO: This option compresses your PBO file, reducing its size. Please note that this option may cause issues with files larger than 2048MB.
3. Convert Configs: This option converts your .cpp configs to .bin format.

All of these options are optional, so you can enable or disable them as desired by selecting "y" or "n".

After the process is complete, you will receive a "success" message along with the location of your file and the hash of your PBO. You can then include this file in your server, knowing that it is much more difficult for workshop thieves to steal your source code. For best results, we recommend separating your code into a client PBO and a server PBO.

If you require assistance, please feel free to create a ticket on our Discord channel at https://discord.pbo.tools.
